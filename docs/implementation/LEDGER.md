## Current milestone
IB07 — Current-host metadata, Post facts and scope corrections: **complete, PASS(scope)** (`docs/implementation/IB07_COMPLETION_RECORD.md`).

The next milestone, IB08 — Reversible native rendition integration, is eligible but not started. It needs its own assignment.

## Current state
- Branch `implementation/ib00-baseline`. Production `Booru_Enhancer.user.js` blob `32d0051fe73505984066a5b69766b5eafc242bb9` (commit `c551bb0`), unchanged by closeout.
- IB07 PASS(scope):
  - Rule34: native listing identity (no listing Post) and logged-out image post;
  - e621 and e926 (independently): native listing Posts and logged-out image post;
  - Gelbooru: logged-out native image post; listing gallery inactive where no candidate container matches.
  - All native-only; the unusual slot shapes fail closed and stay NOT OBSERVED LIVE.
- Post contract:
  - `siteId` is the canonical site identity for qualified hosts;
  - `pageCount` is `null` (unknown) or a positive integer, set to 1 only by the qualified single-item producers.
- Rebuilt conformance packages and exact-artifact results are committed.

## Verified
- Live exact-artifact conformance on `c551bb0`: 7/7 PASS, 0 failed checks, C00 matched on each.
  - Rule34 listing 42 cards and image post;
  - e621 listing 72/72 and image post;
  - e926 listing 74/74 and image post;
  - Gelbooru image post 16/16.
- Local:
  - item 9 31/31; `pageCount` 11/11; excluded hosts and preferences 8/8;
  - Gelbooru native-post 14/14; conformance verifiers 60/60 and 29/29; slot-probe verifier 53/53;
  - IB01 14/14; IB02 21/21; IB03 11/11; IB05 23/23; IB06 21/21.
- No endpoint strategy is reachable: the Gelbooru-family DAPI/HTML helpers and the legacy `normalizeE621` are uncalled, and the native producers contain no network call.

## Unresolved
- **Retained limitations (not blockers):**
  - Live request counting starts at the postamble. Synchronous pre-postamble startup requests are not counted live; the local item 9 T1/T2 suite is the startup evidence.
  - The earlier slot-provenance live runs stay POTENTIALLY CONTAMINATED / SUPERSEDED.
  - Tampermonkey and Chrome versions were not relayed.
- Deferred to later checkpoints: video/GIF, pagination, hover, viewer, favorites/actions, downloads, rendition, other hosts, Pixiv.
- Parked: raw IDs in other hosts' manifest rows; the IB04 checksum/line-ending issue; stale IB08 audit wording.

## Next
Await an explicit IB08 assignment. Do not start IB08 without it.
